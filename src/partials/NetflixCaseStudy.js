    <div className={sectionTitle}>CONTEXT</div>
    <p className={paragraph}>
      With numerous streaming platforms available, Netflix faces the challenge of standing out in a saturated market. Users often feel overwhelmed by the selection, leading to decision fatigue. Despite Netflix’s algorithmic recommendations, many users struggle to find content that resonates with their preferences.
    </p>
    <p className={paragraph}>
      This case study explores how to improve Netflix’s content discovery experience by refining the recommendation system to make it more personalized, relevant, and intuitive. By reducing decision fatigue and offering quicker, more relevant suggestions, the goal is to increase user engagement and retention. This study will examine the challenges, solutions and potential impact of improving content discovery on Netflix.

    <p className={paragraph}>
      Netflix leads the global streaming market with over 300 million paid subscribers and a 21% share in the U.S., just behind Amazon Prime Video. Despite strong growth, including 41 million new subscribers in 2024, users often feel overwhelmed by broad content recommendations.

    {/* AUDIENCE */}
    <div className={sectionTitle}>THE AUDIENCE</div>
    <h3 className={subheading}>Who are the users driving this growth?</h3>
    <ul className={list}>
      <li><span className={highlight}>Ages:</span> Millennials are the most active users, making up 33% of the user base.</li>
      <li>Europe, the Middle East, and Africa represent Netflix’s largest markets, with 96.13 million subscribers.</li>
      <li>On average, Americans spend 62.1 minutes daily on Netflix.</li>
    </ul>
    <p className={paragraph}>
      To design the most impactful universal feature, we should focus on:
      <ul className="list-disc ml-8">
        <li>Younger Generation</li>
        <li>Spend shorter periods browsing</li>
      </ul>
      Our solution will ultimately provide value for all Netflix users, across all regions and age groups, but solving core pain points for the younger generation—who spend shorter periods browsing and shaping the future of streaming—is table stakes.
    </p>
    <p className={paragraph}>
      A younger generation who spends shorter periods browsing represents a significant portion of Netflix’s user base, and their viewing habits are shaping the future of streaming. These users seek efficiency and value in their experience, so addressing their need for quick and relevant content discovery will enhance their experience, reduce frustration, and improve overall engagement.
    </p>

    {/* USER INSIGHTS */}
    <div className={sectionTitle}>USER INSIGHTS</div>
    <h3 className={subheading}>What are the pain points that these users need addressed?</h3>
    <ul className={list}>
      <li>
        <span className={highlight}>Users seek relevant recommendations:</span> Users are seeking time-efficient entertainment options. Netflix’s own data suggests that users spend up to 10% of their viewing time deciding what to watch. For a user in NYC who spends an average of 6 hours a week searching for and watching content, this translates to approximately 1.5 hours per month spent just on decision-making. This decision fatigue reduces enjoyment and engagement. Improving Netflix’s personalized recommendation engine could cut decision making time, allowing users to maximize their viewing experience while reducing frustration.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className={highlight}>Users search dynamic personalization based on changing interests:</span> If Netflix’s algorithm adapts to shifts in user interests within 1-2 viewing sessions, it could lead to a measurable increase in user engagement. Users are more likely to continue streaming when their preferences are understood and catered to. A quicker adaptation may reduce the likelihood of users abandoning the platform due to stale recommendations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span className={highlight}>Users want to discover hidden gems:</span> Users want to discover lesser-known shows and movies that align with their preferences but often struggle to find them amid mainstream options. By surfacing niche content tailored to individual tastes, Netflix could create a more engaging and personalized experience.
      </li>
    </ul>
