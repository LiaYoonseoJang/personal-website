        Improving Algorithmic Transparency on Instagram

        Empowering college-aged creators and users through clarity, feedback, and control.

      {/* CONTEXT */}
      <h3 className={sectionTitle}>Context</h3>
      <p className={paragraph + " mb-6"}>
        Instagram’s recommendation algorithm plays a central role in shaping what users see—affecting not only individual user experiences but also content reach and creator visibility. Many college-aged users (18–24) report frustration and confusion about how the algorithm prioritizes posts, stories, and reels. This lack of transparency leads to decreased trust in the platform and uncertainty around how to grow their audience or engage meaningfully with content.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph + " mb-6"}>
        This case study focuses on urban college students with interests in photography, fashion, and social media—users who are both content creators and consumers. With relatively low-to-moderate income levels and high motivations to gain visibility or share life experiences, this segment is particularly sensitive to changes in algorithmic behavior. By increasing transparency into how content is ranked and surfaced, Instagram has the opportunity to improve user trust, foster more intentional engagement, and empower creators to better navigate the platform.
      </p>

      {/* HYPOTHESIS */}
      <h3 className={sectionTitle + " mb-6"}>Hypothesis</h3>
      <p className="text-pink-400 font-semibold mb-6">
        <span className={highlight}>If Instagram introduces a centralized algorithm transparency hub that explains how feed content is ranked, includes a “Why am I seeing this?” label for all post types, and offers user controls to adjust feed preferences, then trust in the platform and intentional engagement will increase among users.</span>
      </p>

      {/* THE MARKET */}
      <h3 className={sectionTitle + " mb-6"}>The Market</h3>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        Competitors like TikTok and YouTube have taken meaningful steps toward improving algorithmic transparency by introducing features such as “Why this video?” explanations and tools to reset or influence recommendation systems. TikTok allows users to better understand how their For You feed is curated and offers more control over suggested content, while YouTube enables users to manage their watch history to shape future recommendations. Even outside of social media, platforms like Spotify offer subtle algorithm insights through personalized labels like “Made for You” or “Because you listened to...,” reinforcing that users respond positively to transparency in algorithm-driven experiences.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph + " mb-6"}>
        Despite this, Instagram’s current transparency tools remain limited, providing partial explanations for ads or suggested posts without a comprehensive, user-facing breakdown. As regulatory pressure mounts and Gen Z users increasingly demand control and clarity, there is a clear industry trend toward greater algorithm explainability.
      </p>


      {/* AUDIENCE */}
      <h3 className={sectionTitle+ " mb-6"}>The Audience</h3>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        The target audience for this feature is college-aged Instagram users between 18 and 24, primarily based in urban areas across the United States and other major global cities, where digital engagement and creator culture are especially active. These users often play dual roles as both content consumers and casual creators, regularly posting stories, reels, and photos to share their experiences, build a following, or connect with niche communities.
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph + " mb-6"}>
        Many are deeply invested in growing their visibility but feel frustrated by the lack of clarity around how the algorithm influences what content gets seen. Their interests often span social media, photography, fashion, lifestyle, and self-expression, and they are highly motivated to understand and optimize their presence on the platform. This group includes personas like student influencers, aspiring creatives, and digitally fluent students, all of whom are especially sensitive to algorithmic shifts that affect engagement and discoverability.
      </p>

      {/* USER INSIGHTS */}
      <h3 className={sectionTitle}>User Insights</h3>
      <p className={paragraph}>
        Interview and secondary research consistently reveal that college-aged users often feel confused, disempowered, or skeptical about how Instagram’s algorithm works. One student noted, “Sometimes my posts get 100 likes, and sometimes 20 even when I post at the same time. I have no idea why.” Another commented, “I just want to know how to get my content seen without guessing what the algorithm wants.”
      </p>
      <p className={paragraph + " mb-6"}>
        In a 2023 Pew Research survey, 62% of social media users aged 18–24 reported feeling unsure about why certain content appears in their feed, and over 70% said they would value more transparency and control over recommendations. Additionally, internal studies from Meta found that Instagram use was linked to body image concerns and self-esteem issues with algorithm-driven comparisons being a key factor. These insights point to a core user need: greater clarity, predictability, and control over content visibility to reduce frustration and foster more authentic engagement.
